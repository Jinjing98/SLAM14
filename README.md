# SLAM14

I took a slam course from GAOXIANG.
I read through the book and followed this author to recode from scratch what he 
has achieved in this repo " https://github.com/gaoxiang12/slambook", which includes
basic visual odometry(for Mono cam mostly) part, loop closure and optimization etc.

The visual odometry part is under the directory "project", 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 are four different versions of the VO.
